# Getting Started with Vite

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

---

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

---

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

---

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [building for production](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html) for more information.

---

### `npm run preview`

Once you've built the app, you may test it locally by running `npm run preview` command.

The `preview` command will boot up a local static web server that serves the files from dist at [http://localhost:4173](http://localhost:4173). It's an easy way to check if the production build looks OK in your local environment.
